# **A Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project**

This project demonstrates data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques using a dataset of job postings from Glassdoor. It answers key questions about **salaries**, **in-demand skills**, and **industry trends**.  
The project is designed to help aspiring data scientists understand the importance of **data preprocessing** and how **EDA** can reveal actionable insights.

---

## **Features**
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, standardize columns, and remove inconsistencies using Python.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize salary trends, skills demand, and industry insights.
- **Visualizations**: Includes interactive and static plots for better storytelling.

---

## **Source**
- **Dataset**: Glassdoor Job Postings Dataset  
- **Disclaimer**: This dataset was sourced from Glassdoor. It is used for demonstration purposes only; no confidential data was included.

---

## **Project Structure**
- **`cleaning_raw_data.py`**: Script for cleaning and transforming the dataset.  
- **`EDA_jobs.py`**: Script for performing EDA and generating visualizations.

---

## **Key Insights**
- **Salary Trends**: Data scientists in California earn the highest average salaries.  
- **Skills Demand**: Python and SQL are the most sought-after skills.  
- **Industry Trends**: The tech industry offers the highest-paying roles.

### Tips for Improvement:
- Add an **Installation** section for others to replicate your work.  
- Include example **images** of your visualizations directly in the README to make it visually appealing. You can use:
   ```markdown
